// This file tests topic inclusions and inheritence:
//
// includes: this means that the topic "includes" the triggers present
//           in another topic. Matching triggers in the source and included
//           topic are possible, and the *reply* in the source topic overrides
//           the reply in the included topic.
// inherits: all triggers in the source topic have higher matching priority than
//           all triggers in the inherited topic. So if the source topic has a
//           trigger of simply *, it means NO triggers can possibly match on the
//           inherited topic, because '*' goes higher in the match list.

	// All of these triggers have higher matching priority than all other
	// triggers from the other topics, because this topic inherits a topic. So

	// Because our "north" is near the top of the match list, ours always gets

	// the global topic.

// in puzzle1 and type "north"... north was included from "puzzle", but
// puzzle1 doesn't have a reply, so the reply from "puzzle" is given.
