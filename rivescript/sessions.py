class SessionManager(object):
    """Base class for session management for RiveScript.

    The session manager keeps track of getting and setting user variables,
    for example when the ``<set>`` or ``<get>`` tags are used in RiveScript
    or when the API functions like ``set_uservar()`` are called.

    By default RiveScript stores user sessions in memory and provides methods
    to export and import them (e.g. to persist them when the bot shuts down
    so they can be reloaded). If you'd prefer a more 'active' session storage,
    for example one that puts user variables into a database or cache, you can
    create your own session manager that extends this class and implements its
    functions.

    See the ``eg/sessions`` example from the source of rivescript-python at
    https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-python for an example.

    The constructor takes no required parameters. You can feel free to define
    ``__init__()`` however you need to.

    This session manager keeps all user and state information in system
    memory and doesn't persist anything to disk by default. This is suitable
    for many simple use cases. User variables can be persisted and reloaded
    from disk by using the RiveScript API functions ``get_uservars()`` and
    ``set_uservars()`` -- for example, you can get export all user variables
    and save them to disk as a JSON file when your program shuts down, and on
    its next startup, read the JSON file from disk and use ``set_uservars()``
    to put them back into the in-memory session manager.

    If you'd like to implement your own session manager, for example to use
    a database to store/retrieve user variables, you should extend the base
    ``SessionManager`` class and implement all of its functions.
